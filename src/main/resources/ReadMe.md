# STEPS

## GETTING STARTED
1. ADD SPRING SECURITY STARTER DEPENDENCY
2. CREATE A REST CONTROLLER AND ADD A GET METHOD ROUTE
3. MAKING A GET REQUEST TO THAT ENDPOINT GIVES 401 UNAUTHORIZED
4. SPRING SECURITY BY DEFAULT CREATES A USER 'USER' AND CREATES A PASSWORD WHICH IS DISPLAYED IN THE LOGS.
5. WE CAN USE THEM TO LOG IN AND ACCESS DATA FROM /data ROUTE.

## EDITING SPRING SECURITY AUTHENTICATION
1. SPRING SECURITY BY DEFAULT USES LOGIN FORM TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION AND CREATES A DEFAULT USER WITH DEFAULT PASSWORD.
2. WE CAN OVERRIDE THIS AND ADD OUR OWN TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION AND ADD OUR OWN TYPE OF USER.

### ADDING OUR OWN USERS FOR AUTHENTICATION
1. WE CREATE A CONFIGURATION CLASS WITH ANNOTATIONS 'CONFIGURATION' AND 'ENABLE WEB SECURITY'.
2. WE CREATE A METHOD WHICH RETURNS 'InMemoryUserDetailsManager' AND MARK THIS METHOD AS 'BEAN'.
3. THIS METHOD WILL RETURN A USER DETAILS MANAGER WHICH WILL CREATE USERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE.
4. A USER CONTAINS USERNAME, PASSWORD AND A COLLECTION OF 'GRANTED AUTHORITY'. 
5. GRANTED AUTHORITY IS BASICALLY AN AUTHORITY THAT WE ARE GOING TO GRANT TO THE USER.
6. AFTER CREATING USERS WE RETURN A NEW INSTANCE OF 'InMemoryUserDetailsManager' AND PASS THE LIST OF USERS TO IT.
7. NOW WE HAVE TO CREATE A METHOD THAT RETURNS A PASSWORD ENCODER AND MARK IT AS BEAN. IN OUR CASE WE USE 'NoOpPasswordEncoder'.
