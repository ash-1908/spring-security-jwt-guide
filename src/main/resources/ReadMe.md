# STEPS

## GETTING STARTED
1. ADD SPRING SECURITY STARTER DEPENDENCY
2. CREATE A REST CONTROLLER AND ADD A GET METHOD ROUTE
3. MAKING A GET REQUEST TO THAT ENDPOINT GIVES 401 UNAUTHORIZED
4. SPRING SECURITY BY DEFAULT CREATES A USER 'USER' AND CREATES A PASSWORD WHICH IS DISPLAYED IN THE LOGS.
5. WE CAN USE THEM TO LOG IN AND ACCESS DATA FROM /data ROUTE.
