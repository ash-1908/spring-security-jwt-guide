# STEPS

## GETTING STARTED
1. ADD SPRING SECURITY STARTER DEPENDENCY
2. CREATE A REST CONTROLLER AND ADD A GET METHOD ROUTE
3. MAKING A GET REQUEST TO THAT ENDPOINT GIVES 401 UNAUTHORIZED
4. SPRING SECURITY BY DEFAULT CREATES A USER 'USER' AND CREATES A PASSWORD WHICH IS DISPLAYED IN THE LOGS.
5. WE CAN USE THEM TO LOG IN AND ACCESS DATA FROM /data ROUTE.

## EDITING SPRING SECURITY AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
1. SPRING SECURITY BY DEFAULT USES LOGIN FORM TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION AND CREATES A DEFAULT USER WITH DEFAULT PASSWORD.
2. WE CAN OVERRIDE THIS AND ADD OUR OWN TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION AND ADD OUR OWN TYPE OF USER.

### ADDING OUR OWN USERS FOR AUTHENTICATION
1. WE CREATE A CONFIGURATION CLASS WITH ANNOTATIONS 'CONFIGURATION' AND 'ENABLE WEB SECURITY'.
2. WE CREATE A METHOD WHICH RETURNS 'InMemoryUserDetailsManager' AND MARK THIS METHOD AS 'BEAN'.
3. THIS METHOD WILL RETURN A USER DETAILS MANAGER WHICH WILL CREATE USERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE.
4. A USER CONTAINS USERNAME, PASSWORD AND A COLLECTION OF 'GRANTED AUTHORITY'. 
5. GRANTED AUTHORITY IS BASICALLY AN AUTHORITY THAT WE ARE GOING TO GRANT TO THE USER.
6. AFTER CREATING USERS WE RETURN A NEW INSTANCE OF 'InMemoryUserDetailsManager' AND PASS THE LIST OF USERS TO IT.
7. NOW WE HAVE TO CREATE A METHOD THAT RETURNS A PASSWORD ENCODER AND MARK IT AS BEAN. IN OUR CASE WE USE 'NoOpPasswordEncoder'.

### ADDING OUR OWN AUTHORIZATION
1. TO SEE AUTHORIZATION IN ACTION WE WILL RENAME OUR EXISTING ROUTE TO USER AND CREATE TWO MORE ROUTES WITH THE NAMES ADMIN AND MANAGER AND RETURN RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY.
2. NOW IN OUR SECURITY CONFIGURATION CLASS WE CREATE A METHOD THAT RETURNS 'SecurityFilterChain' AND TAKES IN 'HttpSecurity' AS AN ARGUMENT, AND THROWS AN EXCEPTION, THAT COMES FROM 'HttpSecurity'.
3. IN THIS METHOD WE DEFINE WHICH AUTHORITY IS ALLOWED TO ACCESS WHICH ROUTE.
4. WE USE 'HttpSecurity' OBJECT, SUPPOSE 'http', TO FIRST DISABLE CROSS-SITE-REQUEST-FORGERY, TO BE ABLE TO MAKE REQUESTS THEN WE AUTHORIZE REQUEST USING ANTMATCHERS AND JOIN A ROLE TO THEM.
5. NOW WE SEE THAT USER WITH 'USER' ROLE IS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS ROUTES FOR MANAGER AND ADMIN, USER WITH 'MANAGER' ROLE IS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS ROUTE FOR ADMIN AND USER WITH ROLE 'ADMIN' IS ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THE ROUTES.

## ADDING OUR OWN USER REPOSITORY
1. SPRING SECURITY MAINTAINS ITS OWN 'User' CLASS, 'UserDetails' INTERFACE, AND 'UserDetailsService' INTERFACE.
2. WE CAN IMPLEMENT 'UserDetails' AND 'UserDetailsService' INTERFACES AND CONNECT OUR DATABASE TO THEM.
3. TO CONNECT OUR DATABASE, MAKE A REPOSITORY AND IMPLEMENT 'UserDetailsService', THEN OVERRIDE THE METHOD 'loadUserByUsername'.
4. THEN IN OUR SECURITY CONFIG CLASS, CHANGE THE NAME 'InMemoryUserDetailsManager' TO 'configAuthentication' TO MAKE IT MORE APPROPRIATE, AND ADD 'HttpSecurity' OBJECT TO ITS PARAMETER.
5. NOW IN SECURITY CONFIG CLASS, CREATE AN AUTOWIRED OBJECT FOR YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF 'UserDetailsService'.
6. IN OUR 'configAuthentication' METHOD, USE 'HttpSecurity' OBJECT TO GET THE SHARED OBJECT OF AUTHENTICATION MANAGER BUILDER AND ADD THE AUTOWIRED OBJECT OF YOUR USER DETAILS SERVICE, THEN ADD THE BUILD METHOD.
